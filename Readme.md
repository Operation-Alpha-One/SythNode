Hello and welcome to the new age and music production.`
No more will you ever need physical hardware, messey wires, or expensive equitment that can get damaged, lost, or stolen.`
Become a Super DJ , Mixer, or Rockstar with Super SyntNode!`
The concept of Bringing Cloud computing, Modular Design, and Team Collaboration at your fingertips will revolutionalze the music industry.`
Before software developers created software that attempt to recreate the expiearance of having an actual piece of hardware that can emulate a certian device... `
no matter how advanced your computer was or is always broke down, the problem is the mutli threads and processes jumble up like wires and effect the real time streaming`
of you I/O ports.`
Your system freezes or data becomes corrupt in your system cash and you cant have an effectual system of real time live production of advanced modular music production`
at all.`
With the advent of API protocols, SaaS, FaaS and all the other CDN , VMwares out that provide Endpoint Functions through the Backend the wires have been removed from the`
equation.`
Advances in programming systems like Node.js , Next, VUE, React, Markdown, Kotlin and Typescript. We now can provide seamless Front End manifestation for any kind of`
visual interface that you may have that has an internet connection.`
This eliminates the need for expensive computer hardware. All you need is a reliable internet connection. `
Our new technology called HyperNode is designed to work like seperate modules that can be connected together to create a super advanced sound board to genarate the `
perfect sound effect that you desire.`
The Term Module is replaced with Nodualer Intefaces where Micro Instances are created in the cloud throu virtual machines connect with each other throgh kubernates.`
Finnaly APIs and Bots use a new system called FaaS to automate the delivery and infrastruture to get the various pieces working together and bring you single layered `
audio nodes to your computer that you can easly mute, enhance or fire when ever you want or need it too.`
Each Nodualer Micro Thread can be independly operated in person or even remotely along side of you so your entire production team can collaborate with you anywhare in `
the world or even galaxy... Once Startlink is fully activated.`
Each sub system is like having its own computer and set of resources , and code just like having a physical device that is designed for a specific operation. Nothing` 
more nothing less. `
Thats why they work so well... `
We will design our own Bootstrap so you can take full advantage of our tech. Called SSNik OS  Super Synth Node Interface Kernel , That will eliminate all the stupid crap`
that is smushed together on your computer system that takes up CPu and Ram processes and re calibrates your computer to do 1 thing and that is to Recieve Node Packets and`
Capture your Input Commands..`
Channels are opened with the minimum allowed Sockets that broken up into a handfull of sets .. The I/O stream of the Nodular Interface you activated, I/O Sockets of your `
Macro Systems , and Your SSH and Internet Ports...  You can Increase The amount of Channels you have open to allow more Interfaces to Stream to you or you can redirect`
data flows to your teams and they can mix and redirect them back to you as a single channel feed...`
The possibilitys are endless, Open Source and completely Community driven for expandibilty and creative exploration and expression....`
I hope you join me in this project and we will have an incrediable journey into the future of musical expressio that we as race so much desires ....` \
